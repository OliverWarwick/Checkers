# Checkers
Checkers text-based game. With human, and computer player classes.

# Intro
At the moment the computer player plays using an algorithm developed by observing the game, standard moves and logical trades. For example the computer player can look ahead by up to 3 moves considering if a move is made whether any of its own pieces become endangered, or whether it can take 2 pieces over a sequence of moves with the opponent only being able to take one back. 

# Future
I would like to produce a game-tree for the computer player, and then prune the tree to leave moves which are advantagous. I am currently studying an AI module in second year, so game trees will be covered, and the code is in development. 

# How to play. 
Compile the Game.java file, and follow the instructions on screen.
